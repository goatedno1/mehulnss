<p>Plant and animal life in space<br>
Plants <br>
We can grow a variety of plants in space like lettuce, Chinese cabbage, red Russian kale, mizuna mustard, zinnia flowers, chili peppers, etc can be grown which the help of many methods such as hydroponics, veggie method, aquaponic, aeroponic, and also Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) system<br>
 
Animal<br>
Some animals can survive in space such as fruit flies, mice, spiders, tortoise, monkeys, cat, dog, fish, frog, rabbits, etc but as we all know that we need milk and other dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc as they give us a lot of calcium and many other vitamin and minerals and to get these the most suitable is the cow, but it is challenging at the same time to bring the cows and the other animals in space like <br>
•	space for living, <br>
•	abundant grass for herds of cows as they need to eat as much as 3 humans in a month,<br>
•	Food for other animals <br>
•	cost of the arrangement which would take millions, <br>
•	the cows and the other animals may not be able to survive the g force that the cow will face will the launch,<br>
•	 bone loss will happen as the gravity is very less in space causing bone strength and muscle loss, <br>
•	space for growing the plants required for the feeding of cows and other animals<br>
•	And meat for carnivorous animals <br>
But there are a number of advantages <br>
•	Cows can provide milk which is high in calcium and other vitamin and minerals<br>
•	Study of the life in space<br>
•	Medical advantages<br>
•	Greenhouse <br>
•	Manure<br>
•	Bone health<br>
 
Bio technology<br>
We can use bio technology for many purposes in space like<br>
•	Life support systems = we will use bio technology for life sustaining systems which will recycle the waste into food, water and also oxygen<br>
•	Medical care = we can use the bio technology for medical treatments caused by space travel and print tissues and also organs<br>
•	Food production = we can use biotechnology to help produce food for long term lasting life<br>
•	Material production = we will use biotechnology to help us make material that will help us to fulfil the requirements required for the settlements<br>
•	Waste reclamation = biotechnology can help us to create ways that can reclaim waste from mars<br>
•	Bioinformatics = we can use biotechnology to generate large amount of data which can help us upgrade bioinformatics<br>
•	Drug design = we will biotechnology to understand how microgravity affects drugs pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will help us to improve the safety and efficiency of drugs<br>
•	Biomanufacturing = this can help us to increase the space needed by the crew members<br>
•	Artificial photosynthesis = this can help us to create oxygen and other chemicals through artificial photosynthesis<br>
•	Space agriculture = biotechnology will help us to create or develop more nutritious and edible plants which will also grow more efficiently<br>
•	Space cybernetics = can help us to create our own gadgets and electronics<br>
•	Biomaterial = this can used in the places where the gravity is very low like in space and can be used for even transplantation which is nearer to their natural state<br>

 
Nano technology 
•	Building components = we can use nanotechnology to improve the buildings strength and can make it less weight and the cost of transportation will also reduce drastically 
•	Solar cells = we can use nanotechnology to develop advanced solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity more efficiently
•	Sensors = we can use nanotechnology to create nano sensors which can be used to monitor systems and crews’ health in the present time
•	Radiation shielding = we can use nanotechnology to create Radiation shielding for the protection of the life present in the colony
•	Space suits = the nano sensors will be used in the inner body or layer of the space suit which will monitor the astronaut’s health from time to time and will give the information back to the base for precautions
•	Propulsion = will be used as propellants and fuel which will improve propulsion performance like speed
•	Nano coatings = nanotechnology will be used to enhance the durability in the buildings
•	Nanoelectronics = we can use nanotechnology to create smaller and more energy efficient gadgets or electronic devices
